# yiitube

yii framework 1.x widget to render videos from videos hosting sites (youtube, vimeo ...)

Original file extension comes from [here](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/yiitube).

## Changelog :

- prefixed video service (players) constants with 'SERVICE' eg YOUTUBE becomes SERVICE_YOUTUBE - That's (at least) for better readability while using ide autocompletion. merged from constants-refactoring branch.

I'm currently new to git and github, sorry if strange merges, commit happens.
